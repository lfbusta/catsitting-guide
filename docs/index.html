          the standing to the sitting positions, so we'll leave it down and locked.</li>

        Our cats are two sisters from the same litter from 2018. They get along well enough but
        sometimes like to fight. If they do, it's usually Mochi who starts it. Please break it up.

            <p>Cuddly, calm, and gentle. Maki can take a bit to warm up to
              people, but she is very affectionate and loves attention when she gets to know you.
              She prefers to be the one approaching you, not the other way round. If you enjoy
              lap-cats, you are in luck, because once she warms up to you she will want to be on
              your lap an awful lot! She’s really playful as well and loves to shuffle against the
              side of our couch. You can also relax a lot more when Make is around food compared to
              Mochi - sometimes she counter surfs but that's about it. But she is quite fussy with
              the litter box. If it’s not clean she might go somewhere else!</p>

            <p>Playful, SMART, and food obsessed. She WILL get into any
              food you leave accessible to her, even if its inside a package or your bag. We
              recommend to put Mochi in the bedroom when you’re cooking or even eating. Please don’t
              let her eat any of your food either, we are trying to train her to not expect food
              from people. Also, be careful when she gets very playful and starts rolling around on
              the floor. If you pet her she can play very rough and bites hard. Just disengage and
              play with her using a toy instead. Despite her quirks, she’s a very loving cat and
              loves cuddles and attention. She likes to get pets on your lap, and when she’s in a
              good mood she’ll often go to the kitchen and start rolling around the floor. This
              means she’s happy and wants to get a bit of attention.</p>

        <li>To make things easier for you, serve both plates with food first, add water, take both
          plates with you to the bedroom and put Maki's food down, then go next to the front door
          and put Mochi's plate down. They'll know whats going on and follow you around accordingly.

        <li>Please add a bit of warm water to their bowls when you feed them wet food. Enough to
          almost fill the plate. We don’t have a separate water bowl so we give them their water
          through their meals.</li>
        <li>You can use the cylindrical Tupperware to store leftover wet food in the can. There may

        <li>We will leave their food bowl where they normally eat so you know, and their food

        <li>As long as nothing is damaged and things are cleaned we are perfectly happy.</li>
        <li>Make sure the cats always have access to both litter boxes <i>i.e.</i> don't leave the
          door to the bathroom closed. It's ok to throw Mochi in the bedroom while you're
          cooking/eating though. Just let her out once you're done.</li>

        <li>We also have a PS5, feel free to play anythign you like. Just make sure to start a new

        <li>There's an electronic drum kit in the bedroom. We normally keep a rug under it to
          protect the floor but maki likes to pee on it sometimes so we take it out whenever we

      <ul class="list mb-6">
        <li>The apartment stays at about 19ºC with the heating off in the winter. You can turn it on
          by rotating the dial next to the front door and in the bedroom next to the door.</li>
        <li> We usually leave it at the 11 o'clock position.</li>
        <li>We have underfloor heating so it might take up to 8 hours for the apartment to heat up,
          so there is no point switching it off at night.</li>
        <li>We have a thermometer above the tv if you're curious about the temperature inside.</li>

      <h3 class="h3">Cleaning / Washing</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>It gets dusty fairly quickly because of the cat litter and fur.</li>
        <li>There's a feather duster and a rag to dust surfaces on the white kallax above the
          washing machine.</li>
        <li>You can use the vacuum cleaner (next to the washing machine) or the Roomba (on the
          washing machine). When using the roomba, please make sure to empty it and remove hair
          and
          dust from the moving parts. The roomba cannot handle the rugs, so you'll need the vacuum
          cleaner for that.</li>
        <li>The washing machine is next to the bathroom. Feel free to use our detergent. We
          usually
          wash our clothes with the MISCHWÄCHE program.</li>
        <li>We recommend washing the sheets and duvet cover at least every other week. If you wash
          them in the morning they should be dry by the time you go to sleep at night.</li>
        <li>There's a drying rack behind the door.</li>
        <li>Please use the squeegee (hanging in the shower) to wipe water off the glass panes
          after showering. Berlin has very hard water so calcium deposits build up fast if
          you don’t do this.</li>
        <li>If you see that water in the shower is not draining well, please clean the filter
          of the shower drain. You might have to do this every 2-3 weeks.</li>
        <li>Feel free to use the dish washer as much as you like. We use P2 usually. Put detergent
          in both areas (Yes, both. Just a little is enough), turn it on, use the arrows to choose
          a
          program, then close the dish washer. It'll start on its own. Usually takes 1-2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Cleaning supplies for the kitchen are found in the kitchen under the sink.</li>

        <li>The trash cans in the apartment are color coded: <span
            class="text-red-700 font-semibold">red</span> takes plastic and composite packaging,
          and
          <span class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">grey</span> is for other trash. There is a
          paper
          bin lined with a tote bag we use for paper trash, and a special bio bag for food waste
          (it’s green- we’ll leave one out for you). The cat litter goes in the <span
            class="text-green-700 font-semibold">green</span> bin next to the washing machine.
          It’s
          generally good to double bag this as the litter gets quite heavy.
        </li>
        <li>Trash can be taken out to the building trash room, which is
          accessible through the basement. To get there: go to floor -1, exit to the underground
          car
          park, walk straight to the other side of the room, on your left enter the door labeled
          “Bossestrasse 6a”, go up the stairs to the ground floor, exit to the garden, and walk
          right for a few steps. There will be a door on your right which you need your key to
          enter. The trash cans are also color coded. You can check the pictures they have to see
          what goes where but the classification goes as follows: Yellow is for plastics and
          packaging, black is for general rubbish (restmull), brown for food waste, and blue is
          generally for paper (the ones with a weird hamster). Cat litter goes in the black
          (restmull) bin. Feel free to leave the glass in the apartment. Just wash it and we'll
          take
          it out when we're back.</li>
