        <li>Please don't smoke inside.</li>
        <li>Feel free to invite friends over. The walls are super thick so you probably won't
          bother
          the neighbours. As long as nothing is damaged and things are cleaned we are perfectly
          happy.</li>
        <li>Make sure the cats always have access to both litter boxes <i>i.e.</i> don't leave the
          door to the boathroom closed. Its ok to throw Mochi in the bedroom while you're
          cooking/eating though. Just let her out once youre done.</li>

        <li>Our front door closes by itself so make sure you always have the key with you when you
          go out.</li>
        <li>We have two spare keys in case things go wrong: A neighbour in the same building, and a
          friend who lives nearby. We'll give you their contact details over whatsapp.</li>

          front door and in the bedroom next to the door.</li>
        <li>We have underfloor heating so it might take
          up to 8 hours for the apartment to heat up, so there is no point switching it off at
          night.</li>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>We recommend washing the sheets and duvet cover at least every other week. If you wash
          them in the morning they should be dry by the time you go to sleep at night.</li>
        <li>Please use the squeegee (hanging in the shower) to wipe water off the glass panes
          after showering. Berlin has very hard water so calcium deposits build up fast if
          you don’t do this.</li>
        <li>If you you see that water in the shower is not draining well, please clean the filter
          of the shower drain. You might have to do this every 2-3 weeks.</li>
        <li>Please vacuum the apartment because it gets very dusty with
          cat fur quite quickly. You can use the vacuum cleaner (next to the washing
          machine) or the Roomba (on the washing machine). When using the roomba, please
          make sure to empty it and remove hair and dust from the moving parts. The roomba cannot
          handle the rugs, so you'll need the vacuum cleaner for that.</li>
        <li>There's a feather duster and a rug to dust surfaces on the white kallax on top of the
          washing machine.</li>
        <li>Cleaning supplies for the kitchen are found in the kitchen cupboard under the sink.</li>
        <li>Cleaning Supplies for the bathroom and toilet are found in the bathroom cupboard.</li>
        <li>Dishwasher soap, and other kitchen cleaning supplies can be found in the cupboard under
          the sink.</li>
        <li>Washing machine soap is kept in a container on top of the washing machine.</li>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>Garbage bags are all kept in the cupboard under the sink.</li>
        <li>The trash cans in the apartment are color coded: <span
            class="text-red-700 font-semibold">Red</span> takes plastic and composite
          packaging, and <span class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">grey</span> is for other rubbish.
          There is a paper bin lined with a tote bag
          we use for paper trash, and a special bio bag for food waste (it’s green- we’ll leave
          one out for you). The cat litter goes in the <span
            class="text-green-700 font-semibold">green</span> bin next to the washing machine. It’s
          generally good to double bag this as the litter gets quite heavy.</li>
        <li>Garbage can be taken out to the main apartment building garbage room, which is
          accessible through the basement. The directions are: - Go to -1 floor with the elevator -
          Exit the elevator and go to the car park (door on your left) - Walk straight from the car
          park entrance
          to the other side of the room. On your left enter the door labeled “Bossestrasse 6a”
          - Go up the stairs to the ground floor - Exit to the inner garden of the apartment
          block - Walk right for a few steps. There will be a door on your right which you
          need your key to enter. The rubbish bins are also color coded, and you can check
          the pictures they have to see what goes where. Yellow is for plastics and packaging,
          black is for general rubbish, brown for food waste, and blue is generally for paper. Cat
          litter goes in the black bin.</li>

  <section class="p-8 pt-9 bg-slate-100" id="the-cats">
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-4xl font-light">The Cats</h2>
    Our cats are two sisters from the same litter from 2018.
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="mb-1 text-sm font-semibold uppercase">Mochi</h3>
      <p>Playful, SMART, and food obsessed. She WILL get into any food you leave accessible to
        her.
        Even
        if its inside your bag. Even food left in plastic bags is not safe. We recommend to
        put Mochi in the bedroom when you’re cooking or even eating. Please don’t let her
        eat any of your food either, we are trying to train her to not expect food from
        people. Also, be careful when she gets very playful and starts rolling around on the
        floor. If you pet her she can play very rough and bites hard. Just disengage and play
        with her using a toy instead. Despite her quirks, she’s a very loving cat and loves
        cuddles and attention. She likes to get pets on your lap, and when she’s in a good
        mood she’ll often go to the kitchen and start rolling around the floor. This means
        she’s happy and wants to get a bit of attention! Proceede with caution.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="mb-1 text-sm font-semibold uppercase">Maki</h3>
      <p>Cuddly, calm, and gentle.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="mb-1 text-sm font-semibold uppercase">Feeding Instructions</h3>
      <p>They eat wet food twice a day (once when we have lunch and once before we go to sleep) and
        dry snacks once a day (when we have dinner).</p>
      <p>Maki eats 70g of wet food per meal.</p>
      <p>Similar to Mochi, except it’s 60g per wet food meal and she eats in the living room.
        Please also feed her 15g dry food in between but use the food puzzle board instead
        of the ball for Maki. Distribute the food around the board and place it on the floor.</p>
      <p>Maki can take a bit to warm up to people, but she is very affectionate and loves
        attention when she gets to know you. She prefers to be the one approaching you,
        not the other way round :). She’s really playful as well and is much better behaved
        than Mochi when it comes to food! But she is quite fussy with the litter box. If it’s
        not clean she might not use it!</p>
      <p>Mochi eats 80g of wet food per meal.</p>
      <p>70g of wet food from the can per meal, and two meals per day, feeding once at
        12:00 and once at 23:00, times can be adjusted. Please also add a bit of warm water
        to the bowl, about 30ml per meal. We don’t have a separate water bowl so we give
        them their water through wet food and extra water. Mochi normally eats in the
        living room next to the front door. In between the wet food meals please also give
        15g of dry food with the rolling ball food puzzle. Mochi likes this one, all you have
        to do is fill up the ball and place it on the floor, she will push it around to get the
        food out. It’s not so important when you give the dry food, as long as it’s in
        between the wet food meals. It’s also OK to let Mochi use this food puzzle in the
        living room. Food is found in the cupboard above the freezer in the kitchen. You
        can use the cylindrical Tupperware to store leftover wet food in the can. There may
        already be some stored in this Tupperware in the fridge. The dry food is in a large
        bag on the same shelf as the wet food cans. We will place the food puzzles, the
        weighing scale and their bowls on the kitchen counter so it’s easy for you to find.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="mb-1 text-sm font-semibold uppercase">Exercise and Play</h3>
      <p>Cat toys are found on top of the shelf on top of the TV. Both cats love the wand toy
        with a worm on the end. There are extra worms in the blue bag. Please play with
        them whenever you can but don’t leave the toys out without watching them because
        they will try to eat them.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="mb-1 text-sm font-semibold uppercase">Toilet and Grooming</h3>
      <p>Both cats use the litter tray in the bathroom and the tray in the living room, both
        need to be cleaned twice per day, ideally right before they eat. It’s very important to
        get everything out, even the stuff that’s stuck on the side! We use clumping litter,
        and throw the clumps into the green lided bin near the washing machine which we take out
        when full. It’s really important to keep on top of the box cleaning because
        otherwise Maki might pee somewhere else! She is very sensitive to a dirty box.</p>
